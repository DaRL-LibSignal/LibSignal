# GeneraLight
This repo provides code for GeneraLight.
How to run:
1. run run_maml_cluster.py with suitable arguments, which are defined in the code;
2. run task_tailor.py with the saved data by run_maml_cluster.py;
3. run test_maml_cluster.py to get the generalization ability test result.

Sorry that the code in this repo is messy, we will release a clearer version later.
